
This result is generated under the condition there is no block from testbench side.
So in real working environment, the suggested depth may need some margin.

After FIFO sizing, module total executing time has no change.(still 17459 cycles)
The detailed FIFO info are listed below.

        Work mode:
            FIFO never blocks its consumer and producer.
            The possible reason is the FIFO depth is big enough.
