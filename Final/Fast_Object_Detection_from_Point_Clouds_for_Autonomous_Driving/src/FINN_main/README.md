The PointPillars code was based on Vitis-AI C++ implementation.
This repo contains Vitis-AI-Library (a part of Vitis-AI) which was forked from  https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-AI, version 1.3.

The main modifications of PointPillars code from Vitis-AI-Library include:
1. The VitisAI-based PointPillars model was replaced with a FINN-based one
2. A FINN C++ driver was added
3. The PFN was implemented using Eigen3 library

For compiling the code, follow the instructions from Vitis-AI official repository.

The FINN PointPillars implementation is based on this [code](https://github.com/nutonomy/second.pytorch). The PointPillars was first quantised using [Brevitas](https://github.com/Xilinx/brevitas) library and then synthesized for ZCU104 Zynq MPSoC using [FINN](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn).

You can find a package (compiled code, PointPillars FINN model, input data examples) for ZCU104 [here](https://github.com/vision-agh/pp-finn/releases/download/v0.1/ppFINN_ZCU104.zip).
