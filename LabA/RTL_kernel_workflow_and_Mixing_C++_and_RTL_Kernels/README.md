# AAHLS Lab A

## RTL kernel workflow
In this lab, we learned how to use RTL code to generate the kernel and run on Vitis compiler. We also learned about RTL code requirement for Vitis compiler for linking
to other kernels.
## Mixing c and RTL kernel
In this lab, it will be divided into two steps, first we build a c++ kernel, and use host_step1.cpp to see the 
software and hardware simulation result in one kernel. In second step, we use the c++ kernel in first step, and also 
build an RTL kernel by Vitis. Running with two kernels, we can see the result generated by host_step2.cpp.
